# Parameters for each source node (one source node per line):
#
# Definition of (distributed) source positions:
# number of lines in source file NSRC (first line)
# position XSRC, position ZSRC, time-delay TD, centre frequency FC, amplitude AMP, source type ST and number of samples NS 
# (comment line is indicated by # as first character)

# Symbols:
# Parameters for each source node (one source node per line):
# X  = x-coordinate of source point [m]
# Y  = y-coordinate of source point [m]
# Z  = z-coordinate of source point [m]
# TD = excitation time (time-delay) for source node [s]
# FC = centre frequency of source signal [Hz]
# AMP= maximum amplitude of source signal
# ST = source type: ST=1 ... explosion source (energy/time [J/s])
#                   ST=2 ... acceleration in x-direction (acceleration*volume [m4/s2])
#                   ST=3 ... acceleration in y-direction (acceleration*volume [m4/s2])
#                   ST=4 ... acceleration in z-direction (acceleration*volume [m4/s2])
#                   ST=5 ... force in x-direction (force [kg*m/s2])
#                   ST=6 ... force in y-direction (force [kg*m/s2])
#                   ST=7 ... force in z-direction (force [kg*m/s2])
#                   ST=8 ... double couple x-y-plane (energy/time [J/s])
#                   ST=9 ... double couple y-z-plane (energy/time [J/s])
#                   ST=10... double couple x-z-plane (energy/time [J/s])
# NS = number of samples in source signal file
#      corresponding to source defined in that
#      line; if NS=0, the whole content of the
#      source signal file is taken as source signal
#      (applies only if source signal is read from ASCII- or BIN-file)
